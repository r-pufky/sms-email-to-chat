Need:

Python Packages:
- mailbox
- python
- sqlite3

https://github.com/daviddrysdale/python-phonenumbers
install with easy_install

Need to install as root (aggressive sudo umask will mess up imports)
if screwed up, easy_install -m [package]
then rm -rfv /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/[package]*
